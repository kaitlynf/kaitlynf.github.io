# Hello, I'm Kaitlyn Fu.

I am graduating senior from University of California, Santa Barbara with double degrees in Geography, B.A. and Global Studies, B.A. I enjoy learning about urbanism and sustainability, and hope to work in the urban planning field in the near future.

I hope use the skills I acquired throughout my undergraduate career to transform urban spaces to strengthen communities, protect the environment, and foster sustainable development. You can reach me at 99kaitlyn@gmail.com.
